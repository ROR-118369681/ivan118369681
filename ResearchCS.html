<center>  <div><h1><ins><center>BLOCKCHAIN</center></ins></h1>The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. 
    But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?
By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. 
Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin, the tech community has now found other potential uses for the technology.
    
A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned 
    A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. 
    Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain)

<center>  <div><h1><ins><center>AUTONOMOUS THINGS (ROBOTICS)</center></ins></h1>Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in 
        environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even 
        capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment. Today’s industrial 
        robots do not resemble human beings; a robot in human form is called an android.
        <p>Industrial robotics can be considered a combination of numerical-control and teleoperator technologies. Numerical control provides the concept of a programmable industrial machine, and teleoperator technology contributes the notion
            of a mechanical arm to perform useful work. The first industrial robot was installed in 1961 to unload parts from a die-casting operation. Its development was due largely to the efforts of the Americans George C. Devol, an inventor, 
            and Joseph F. Engelberger, a businessman. Devol originated the design for a programmable manipulator, the U.S. patent for which was issued in 1961. Engelberger teamed with Devol to promote the use of robots in industry and to establish 
            the first corporation in robotics—Unimation, Inc.</p></div></center>

<center>  <div><h1><ins><center>IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE</center></ins></h1>
        <p>
An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality.
The following are illustrative examples of immersive experience.

<br></br>
<strong>Education</strong>
<br></br>
Pulling digital elements into the classroom with mixed reality or transforming the learning environment with virtual reality. For example, exploring the surface of Mars as part of a science lesson.
<br></br>
<strong>Art</strong>
<br></br>
Contemporary art that is designed to surround the visitor. Immersive experiences can be accomplished without technology as art can transform reality on its own.
<br></br>
<strong>Restaurants</strong>
<br></br>
Restaurants that simulate an unreal environment. For example, a restaurant designed to look like a ninja village complete with actors that draw visitors into a story.
<br></br>
<strong>Events</strong>
<br></br>
Events such as a concert designed to transform the venue such that it resembles a different reality.
<br></br>
<strong>Entertainment</strong>
<br></br>
Theme parks, movies and games that completely surround you. This includes pervasive games that draw virtual elements into the real world. In theory, movies could also occur in the real world.
<br></br>
<strong>Fitness</strong>
<br></br>
Physical activity in a virtual environment that may resemble a game or provide you with excessive real time information about your body.
